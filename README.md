# Basic use

``` python
from fastprogress.fastprogress import master_bar, progress_bar
import time
```

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

``` python
mb = master_bar(range(10))
for i in mb:
    for j in progress_bar(range(100), parent=mb):
        time.sleep(0.01)
        mb.child.comment = f'second bar stat'
    mb.main_bar.comment = f'first bar stat'
    mb.write(f'Finished loop {i}.')
```

## Adding the graph

``` python
import numpy as np
```

``` python
mb = master_bar(range(10))
#Name of the curves to put in the legend box.
mb.names = ['cos', 'sin']
for i in mb:
    for j in progress_bar(range(100), parent=mb):
        time.sleep(0.01)
        mb.child.comment = f'second bar stat'
    mb.main_bar.comment = f'first bar stat'
    mb.write(f'Finished loop {i}.')
    x = np.arange(0, 2*(i+1)*np.pi/10, 0.01)
    y1, y2 = np.cos(x), np.sin(x)
    graphs = [[x,y1], [x,y2]]
    #Specifying the boundaries is better to have the box at the right size.
    x_bounds = [0, 2*np.pi]
    y_bounds = [-1,1]
    mb.update_graph(graphs, x_bounds, y_bounds)
```

Updating every iteration in the inner loop is possible but slower

``` python
mb = master_bar(range(10))
mb.names = ['cos', 'sin']
for i in mb:
    for j in progress_bar(range(100), parent=mb):
        if j%10 == 0:
            k = 100 * i + j
            x = np.arange(0, 2*k*np.pi/1000, 0.01)
            y1, y2 = np.cos(x), np.sin(x)
            graphs = [[x,y1], [x,y2]]
            x_bounds = [0, 2*np.pi]
            y_bounds = [-1,1]
            mb.update_graph(graphs, x_bounds, y_bounds)
            mb.child.comment = f'second bar stat'
    mb.main_bar.comment = f'first bar stat'
    mb.write(f'Finished loop {i}.')
```

Finished loop 0.<p>Finished loop 1.<p>Finished loop 2.<p>Finished loop 3.<p>Finished loop 4.<p>Finished loop 5.<p>Finished loop 6.<p>Finished loop 7.<p>Finished loop 8.<p>Finished loop 9.

## Console rendering

``` python
from fastprogress.fastprogress import ConsoleMasterBar, ConsoleProgressBar
```

``` python
mb = ConsoleMasterBar(range(10))
for i in mb:
    for j in ConsoleProgressBar(range(100), parent=mb):
        time.sleep(0.01)
        mb.child.comment = f'second bar stat'
    mb.write(f'Finished loop {i}.')

You can force the console rendering without changing your code by using
the following command:

``` python
from fastprogress import force_console_behavior
master_bar,progress_bar = force_console_behavior()
```

``` python
mb = master_bar(range(10))
for i in mb:
    for j in progress_bar(range(100), parent=mb):
        time.sleep(0.01)
        mb.child.comment = f'second bar stat'
    mb.main_bar.comment = f'first bar stat'
    mb.write(f'Finished loop {i}.')
    #mb.update_graph(graphs, x_bounds, y_bounds)
```
